# form-validation

In this form validation I have implemented some freatures that create a client side veification. when the user leaves the input feild empty it will create a warning message were the input border turns into red and the exclamation symbol appears. If the input is correct the input feild turns into green. when the user input password and verifing password both the password must be same or else the warning message will appear.
